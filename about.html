        GOAL:<br><br>
            The primary goal for the project was to create a virtual teacher assistant chatbot. 
            The chatbot would have a functional website developed through front-end code and a connected NLP (Natural Language Processing) back-end. 
            The chatbot should understand what the user (student for a specified course) is asking and return the given information. 
            The questions can be about the contact information for the section, exam, quizzes, etc., and questions about the course broken into different layers.
            Essentially, this project will give students an extra resource to use when studying or working on class assignments.<br><br>
